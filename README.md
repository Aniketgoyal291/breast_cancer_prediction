Here’s a concise **GitHub README description** for your Breast Cancer Prediction model:  

---

# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction Model  

This project uses **machine learning** to predict breast cancer based on patient data. It applies **Linear Regression** and **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** for predictions. The dataset is preprocessed, normalized, and evaluated using metrics like **MAE, MSE, and R² Score**.  

## 🔹 Features  
✅ Data preprocessing & normalization  
✅ Machine learning models: **Linear Regression, SVR**  
✅ Performance evaluation with **MAE, MSE, R² Score**  

## 🔹 How to Use  
1️⃣ Clone the repo  
2️⃣ Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3️⃣ Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook Canser_Prediction.ipynb`  

📊 **Results:** The model predicts cancer presence based on input features with statistical evaluation.  

🔗 **Dataset:** Add dataset link if public
