# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction Model  

This project uses **machine learning** to predict breast cancer based on patient data. It applies **Linear Regression** and **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** for predictions. The dataset is preprocessed, normalized, and evaluated using metrics like **MAE, MSE, and R² Score**.  

## 🔹 Features  
✅ Data preprocessing & normalization  
✅ Machine learning models: **Linear Regression, SVR**  
✅ Performance evaluation with **MAE, MSE, R² Score**  

## 🔹 How to Use  
1️⃣ Clone the repo
3️⃣ Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook Canser_Prediction.ipynb`
